GEOL590 final project:

This project is designed to pull chess games from the internet and make them usable for analysis in R.

The most common notation for chess games is “Portable Game Notation” (PGN) and describes how the game progresses move-by-move. A downside of this is that to analyze the board at any moment in the chess game, all moves must be performed in order up to the position in question.

My R package “plays” through the PGN format, saving each position throughout the game as a board snapshot in the form of a data frame (e.g. a game with 50 moves will have 100 board layouts saved). By handling games as collections of board layouts, analysis can occur more easily for individual moves throughout a game.
