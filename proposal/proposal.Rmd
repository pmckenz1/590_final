```

*  Who will participate?
*  Will the project will be a data analysis project or a package?
*  Which git workflow from the Chacon text you will use?
*  What will the project be about?
    *  What is the background for the need for the project? i.e., what problem does it solve, and why does that problem need to be solved?
    *  What is the source of the data? Will real-world data or made-up data be used?
    *  What specifications will the final project meet? I.e., what will you produce (a single plot of this vs that, a set of tools that does these three things, etc)
    *  For group projects, what are the roles of the group members?
